# Overview of the project  

## Objective of the project  
- To create a dynamic and responsive blogging platform website
- Users should be able to sign up, create, edit and delete blog posts
- Implementation of user authentication
- Implementation of comment sections

## Technologies used
- HTML : For creating the basic structure of the web page
- CSS : For designing and styling the web page
- JS : For adding interactivity and responsiveness to the web page

## Task implementation
I have tried to implement the front-end interface of this task to the best of my abilities.  
First, the home page which is displayed when the website is opened is:

There are 2 separate pages for registration and login, when the user first registers, they also have to log in to their account in order to access their dashboard.

Once the dashboard opens, it shows the user's blogs, comments on their dashboard and a text section to write a new blog.

## Implementation constraints  

My implementation of this task has certain constraints because I focused on developing the front-end interface. I hope to refine this project more when I have better knowledge about web development. Some of the constraints of this website are:

- Login authentication with hardcoded values since back-end development has not been done in this implementation
- Use of local storage to save blogs and comments
- Edit option for the blogs opens the blog files
- Delete and edit options for saved blogs cannot be used to modify the blog after refreshing the website

Despite these constraints, I have tried to implement the front-end interface to the best of my abilities. With further improvement of my knowledge and skills in web development, I hope to remove these constraints from this project.
